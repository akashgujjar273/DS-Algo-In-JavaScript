// what is traversing if we had a ll we would just loop it
//but for trees like a binary searchtree it difficult

//one comman way is go to the top node then we go next nodes and there next 
//its called breadth first search

//another aproach we go to the bottom
//eg we go to the bottom left then we go up and go down right
//after doing this on left side from parent we go to the top node the parent
//and after that we go to right side and bcz we were doing left then we go to the bottom left of the right side
//then same go up then right 
//its called depth first search

//the bfs and dfs are two ways and on each way we will learn thre different types on dfs
