//it just show us how to make classes

//and non pointers are like varibale
let num1=5
let num2=num1
let num1=10
//in this case num to will be still 5 and it will not change as later 1 changed because they are not pointing

//but pointers works different almost every ds uses it
//like obj 1 and obj2 if obj 1 points to a value and obj2 =obj1
//and if we change obj1 then obj2 will also change because they are pointing to a value
