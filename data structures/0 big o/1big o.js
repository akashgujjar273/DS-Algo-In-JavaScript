//big o is time complexcity mesured by how fast a code runs
//we mesure it with how many number of operation it runs
//because a faster pc will run code fast thats why not in time but operations

//we also mesuare space complexcity what if a code uses more memory

//big o worst case
//best case omega  average case theta  worst case omnicron is known as o as in big o
//in a array 1 to 7 if we iterate finding 1 is best that is omega and 4 is average and 7 is worst its o
//there is no best or average in big o its always worst and best and average wpold be omegas or theta but big o is always worst
