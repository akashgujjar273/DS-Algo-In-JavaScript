//in graph a node is vertex u can also call it node but proper one is vertex
//if u connect 2 vertex that connection is called edge u can also call it connection


/**
 *       82
 *  2 /   |   15
 *  4----74
 *     3
 *  82 vertex can connect to 4 and 74 or both 
 * a vertex has no limitaions to how many edges it can have 
 */
//eg
//in map we wanna go 82 we can directly go from 74 to 82
//long one is 74 to 4 then 82 but the special thing in graph is the edges can be weighted
//74 and 88 edge has 15 and 74 to 4 is 3 and 4 to 82 is 2

//after weighting those edges the mose effiecient way is now 4 then 82

//it is something also we use in routing protocoles on a network
//two fast link is better then one slow one

//a---b
//bidirectional edge represented with just a line without any arrows
//eg if two people are friend on fb the a and b both are friends that is bidirectional friendship


//eg on insta a follow b but the b doesnt follow a that show a single line of connection represent with arrow

//bst and ll are also kind of graphs
